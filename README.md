# Slim-Magic Blog

A very minimalistic, sample blog application [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com).

The purpose of this application is to test if the [magic](https://github.com/ajaxray/magic) Dependency Container is working with [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com) and also to check the design decisions. 
So, instead of completing the blog centric features, Iâ€™ve focused on demonstrating Dependency Injection Container usages and design layers.

Why Slim? Because it's using [PSR 11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) compliant DI and allows to use any PSR-11 compliant alternative (e,g, PHP-DI
) instead of his built-in DI.
